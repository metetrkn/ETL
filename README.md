## Introduction

Code Stands Down is a Python application that allows users to easily download files from the internet and save them to their local system. Whether you need to fetch data, images, documents, or any other type of file, this application simplifies the process.

## Features

- **File Download**: Download files from URLs.
- **Custom Naming**: Specify custom names for downloaded files.
- **Progress Tracking**: Log the progress of file downloads and other operations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/downloading-file-into-system.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/downloading-file-into-system.git

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas

4. Download the source files for ETL operations:

   ```bash
   # Download the source files
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0221EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/module%206/Lab%20-%20Extract%20Transform%20Load/data/source.zip

# Unzip the source files
unzip source.zip

# Usage
Running the ETL Process
1. Import the necessary libraries and functions:

   ```python
  import pandas as pd
  import glob
  from datetime import datetime
  import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

2. Define the extraction, transformation, loading, and logging functions as provided in the code.

3. Run the ETL process:
   ```python
  # extraction
log('Etl Job Started')
extracted_data = extract_all()
log('Extraction phase is Done!')

# transformation
log('Transformation Job Started')
transformed_data = transform(extracted_data)
log('Transformation phase is Done!')

# loading
log('Loading Job Started')
load(transformed_data)
log('Loading phase is Done!')

# logging

You can track the progress of the ETL process by checking the "logfile.txt" file, which contains timestamped log messages.
